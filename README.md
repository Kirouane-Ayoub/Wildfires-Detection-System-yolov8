# Wildfires Detection System Using YOLOv8
Wildfires Detection System Using YOLOv8 is a computer vision system that uses the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm to identify and locate wildfires in real-time from aerial footage. The system is designed to help firefighters and emergency responders quickly identify the location and extent of wildfires, which can help them more effectively deploy resources and contain the fire.

The YOLOv8 algorithm is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that uses deep neural networks to detect and classify objects in images or video streams. It is based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture, which allows it to process images very quickly and accurately, making it well-suited for real-time applications like wildfire detection.

The system works by processing high-resolution aerial footage in real-time using a GPU-powered computer. The YOLOv8 algorithm is used to identify areas of the image that contain smoke or flames, and the system then uses a clustering algorithm to determine the location and extent of the fire. The system can also be configured to send alerts to firefighters and emergency responders in real-time, allowing them to quickly respond to the fire and contain it before it spreads.

Overall, the Wildfires Detection System Using YOLOv8 is an innovative application of deep learning and computer vision technology that has the potential to help save lives and protect property in the face of wildfires.
